# Codezinger API SDK

The point of this project is to reverse engineer the
codezinger API and then write a wrapper with which I
can get codezinger updates and/or do some-to-None codezinger automation.

# Explaination
- It's more or less an SDK
- At the moment, just import your code and write it in `main.py`. If you are interested in scaling this up, Take the liberty to fork it and contribute.
- I have no interest in maintaining this an a full fledged project. I am just making an SDK for the sake of getting some work done.
